C# is a language that was created by Microsoft and submitted to ECMA for standardization.
Its creators were a team of people at Microsoft that included the guidance of Anders
Hejlsberg. Interestingly, Hejlsberg is a Microsoft Distinguished Engineer who has created
other products and languages, including Borland Turbo C++ and Borland Delphi.
With C#, he and the team at Microsoft focused on using what was right about existing
languages and adding improvements to make something better.

Preparing to Program
You should take certain steps when solving a problem. First, you must define the problem.
If you don’t know what the problem is, you will never find the solution. After you
know what the problem is, you can devise a plan to fix it. When you have a plan, you
can usually implement it. After the plan is implemented, you must test the results to see
whether the problem actually has been solved. This same logic can be applied to many
other areas, including programming.
When creating a program in C# (or in any language), you should follow a similar
sequence of steps:
1. Determine the objective(s) of the program.
2. Determine the methods you want to use in writing the program.
3. Create the program to solve the problem.
4. Run the program to see the results.

The Program-Development Cycle

The program-development cycle has its own steps. 
>>	In the first step, you use an editor to create a file that contains your source code.
>>	In the second step, you compile the source code to create an intermediate file called either an executable file or a library file.
>>	The third step is to run the program to see whether it works as originally planned.

Understanding the Execution of a C# Program
It is important to understand a little bit about how a C# program executes. C# programs
are different from programs that you can create with many other programming languages.
C# programs are created to run on the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR). This
means that if you create a C# executable program and try to run it on a machine that
doesn’t have the CLR or a compatible runtime, the program won’t execute.


if you wrote a C application and you wanted to run it on a Linux
machine and a Windows machine, you would have to create two executable programs—
one on a Linux machine and one on a Windows machine. With C#, you create only one
executable program, and it runs on either machine.
